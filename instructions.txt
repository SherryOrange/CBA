Description: The 2 circles show the best times of Usain Bolt and Justin Gatlin for the 100m sprint

1. The large number is the latest time
2. The movement in market share is measured in seconds 
	eg. Justin Gatlin's 2016 time was 0.06 seconds longer than his 2015 time
		formula: 2016 time (9.80) - 2015 time (9.74)
3. The position of the circle is the variance of the latest time from a previous time. It moves up if the time is slower, and down if it is faster
4. The colour is green if the time is faster, red if slower.
5. The trend line shows 6 years of times, including the current year.
